      <p>Bangladesh is a land of wetland. Wetlands are considered as invaluable components of the ecosystems with enormous economic, ecological, and commercial importance. Haors are rich in biodiversity in terms of floral and faunal composition including migratory birds of global and regional significance. Wetlands are ecosystems whose formation processes, and characteristics are determined by water.Unique resource of nature that form the basis of healthy sustainable habitat for flora and fauna. Wetlands are a critical part of our natural environment, and play a key role in supporting biological diversity. Nature’s Kidney as natural cleansing functions they perform.  Essential resource where poor people depends on it. Also form corridor or stepping stone habitats that support the migration of species. The depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters-according to Ramsar convention.</p>

      <p><strong>Haor:</strong> Haor is an extensive depression, which looks like a saucer with a deep central part with permanent water known as beel. Haors are well-defined eco-systems and provides the sound and environment friendly habitat for aquatic resources especially for fishes and water birds. The central beel of the haor retains water throughout the year. From the central beel its basin rises one all sides. The basin is bounded by a levee, which is locally called ‘khanda’. In khandas, a large occurred in the khandas. The gentle slope between the khanda and the beel is called ‘band’ or meadow which forms the farming lands and pastures. Thus, a haor system is a complex system of both lacustrine and palustrine wetlands depending on the   hydraulic behavior in different seasons. During the monsoon, the entire haor system becomes a single boy of open water linked with the river system. When floodwater recedes, the beels get isolated and remain as distinct water bodies till the next rainy season comes. The haor basin is by far the largest inland depression in the country and derives its name from the multitudeof large lake like fluvial features known as haors. The haor basin is located in the northeastern part of Bangladesh. </p>
